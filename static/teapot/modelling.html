    <div id="purpose" class="sectiontitle">The Importance of Modelling</div>
    <p>Modelling is crucial to test the facets of my teapot that could go (very) wrong. My design evaluation criteria includes a rocking, boiling hot container that not only rocks, but whose weight keeps on changing as water is poured in and out of the teapot. Moreover, my criteria also includes a rocking teapot that does not drip... I know, what could <em>ever</em> go wrong here?</p><hr>
    <p>Given the frailty of my teapot at first glance, I need to make sure that the aspects that could go wrong are modelled before I create a working prototype. Modelling essentially entails representing the functioning of an aspect of my teapot by simplifying and constraining it to a consistent set of rules. These rules are used for interpretation and calibrating the model to understand when things will go wrong and so how to avoid these from going wrong.
    <div id="techniques" class="sectiontitle">Choosing the modelling technique(s): <br>What to Model &amp; How to do it</div>
    <p>I have identified three facets that I want to model:<p>
    <ol> 
      <li>How varying quantities of water in each chamber in my teapot will affect the equilibrium of my teapot on the stand.</li>
      <li>Optimising the dimensions of my teapot's stand.</li>
      <li>Optimsing the thickness of my teapot, which will be made out of ceramics.</li>
    </ol>
    <div id="model" class="sectiontitle">The Model(s)</div>
    <p>I hope to work on the modelling of each of the points above over the next week. Below are some initial thoughts on how to optimise the splitting of the two chambers. I came up with a way (drawn in red) to ensure that the teapot can always be in equilibrium position, regardless of the amount of water inside each chamber. However, a problem that the user will have is that the teapot will never go back to its equilibrium position unless the user makes sure to carefully put back the teapot back to its rest position on the stand. I am currently working to find a way to solve this problem.</p>
